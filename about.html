<p>Hello friend! Welcome to my blog. Here I will be chronicling my journey to becoming a software developer. It will be challenging, and I'm certain at times equally frustrating... but nothing worth having is ever easy. I'm committed to getting there, with engagement, agency, empathy, and grit. </p>

<p>A little about me… I’m creative, ambitious, passionate, and nerdy, with a knack for logic, and a love of technology and design.  I was born and raised in France, moved to Colorado in my teens and have been here ever since, where I make my home in the wonderful city of Denver.</p>

<p>My interest in programming and computers started as a little girl and never waned, even as I was at times actively discouraged from pursuing anything related to it. After many years of teaching myself bits of coding here and there by way of books, workshops, and tutorials, I decided to take the leap to change my career and dedicate my full attention to learning how to code.</p>

<p>So here I am! I invite you to join me as I transform into a wizard… I mean developer.</p>
